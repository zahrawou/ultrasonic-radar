## 📜 Features
- **Real-Time Measurement:** Get immediate distance readings.
- **Easy Setup:** Follow straightforward instructions for installation.
- **Compatibility:** Works with various ultrasonic sensors, including HC-SR04 and RCWL-9610A.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Designed to run efficiently on small devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## 📋 System Requirements
To successfully run ultrasonic-radar, you need:

- A Linux operating system (Ubuntu, Fedora, or others).
- A compatible ultrasonic sensor connected to your device.
- Python 3 installed on your system.

## 🔌 Connecting Your Ultrasonic Sensor
You can connect different ultrasonic sensors to your device following standard wiring. For example, if you're using the HC-SR04 sensor:

1. Connect the VCC pin to the 5V power source.
2. Connect the GND pin to ground.
3. Connect the TRIG pin to a GPIO pin on your device.
4. Connect the ECHO pin to another GPIO pin.

Once connected, you can start interacting with your ultrasonic radar.

## 🛠️ Running the Application
After installing the application, you can run it directly from the terminal. Use the following command:

```bash
python ultrasonic_radar.py
```

Replace "ultrasonic_radar.py" with the actual filename if it is different. This will launch the program, and you will see options for measuring distances.

## ❓ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, here are common problems and solutions:

- **Sensor Not Detected:** Ensure connections are secure and correct.
